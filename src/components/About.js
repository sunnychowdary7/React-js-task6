      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website. I am a dedicated Computer Science and
        Engineering (CSE) student currently in my third year of B.Tech. Over the
        past few years, I've been refining my skills and delving into the
        captivating realm of technology. My journey in CSE has provided me with
        a solid foundation in various programming languages, data structures,
        and algorithms. I'm deeply passionate about utilizing technology to
        address real-world problems and I'm eager to share my experiences and
        projects with you.
